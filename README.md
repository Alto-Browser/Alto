## About

This is the Alto Browser.

## Contributing

I mostly wont be accepting contributions right now because I am still learning swiftUI (and how to code) so I dont want the project to start including code I dont understand. Feel free to make PR but be aware I may not accept it.

## Roadmap

## Acknowledgements

A huge thank you again to the team at Beam for making their code open source. If it was not for there code I would not have been able to make this and would not have learned as much as I have. Unlike other browser companies Beam actualy seem to have cared about there vision for the web so thank you.
